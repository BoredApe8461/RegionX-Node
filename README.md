# Substrate Cumulus Parachain Template

A new [Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/)-based Substrate node, ready for hacking ‚òÅÔ∏è..

This project is originally a fork of the
[Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template)
modified to include dependencies required for registering this node as a **parathread** or
**parachain** to a **relay chain**.

The stand-alone version of this template is hosted on the
[Substrate Devhub Parachain Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/)
for each release of Polkadot. It is generated directly to the upstream
[Parachain Template in Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/tree/master/parachain-template)
at each release branch using the
[Substrate Template Generator](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-template-generator/).

üëâ Learn more about parachains [here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains), and
parathreads [here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parathreads).

üßô Learn about how to use this template and run your own parachain testnet for it in the
[Devhub Cumulus Tutorial](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/cumulus/start-relay/).

## CI

### Binary

Check the [CI release workflow](./.github/workflows/release.yml) to see how the binary is built on CI.
You can modify the compilation targets depending on your needs.

Allow GitHub actions in your forked repository to build the binary for you.

Push a tag. For example, `v0.1.1`. Based on [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), the supported tag format is `v?MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH(-PRERELEASE)?(+BUILD_METADATA)?` (the leading "v", pre-release version, and build metadata are optional and the optional prefix is also supported).

After the pipeline is finished, you can download the binary from the releases page.

### Container

Check the [CI release workflow](./.github/workflows/release.yml) to see how the Docker image is built on CI.

Add your `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` secrets or other organization settings to your forked repository.
Change the `DOCKER_REPO` variable in the workflow to `[your DockerHub registry name]/[image name]`.

Push a tag.

After the image is built and pushed, you can pull it with `docker pull <DOCKER_REPO>:<tag>`.
